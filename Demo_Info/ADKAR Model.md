### ADKAR Model

**Source:**
Developed by Prosci, the ADKAR Model is a popular change management tool that outlines a linear process for organizational change, focusing on individual transitions as a means to achieve overall success.

**What is the ADKAR Model?**
ADKAR is an acronym representing the five sequential goals in change management: Awareness of the need for change, Desire to participate and support the change, Knowledge on how to change, Ability to implement required skills and behaviors, and Reinforcement to ensure change sticks.

**When to Use It:**
- **Implementing New Processes**: Ideal when introducing new procedures or systems within an organization.
- **During Organizational Change**: Useful for managing resistance and ensuring smooth transitions.
- **Training and Development**: Applies to scenarios involving upgrades to skills or introduction of new technologies.

**How to Implement the ADKAR Model Post-Training:**
1. **Awareness**: Communicate the reasons behind the change effectively to all stakeholders. Highlight the benefits and the urgencies to create a compelling need for the change.
2. **Desire**: Foster a supportive climate by involving team members in the change process. Address personal impacts and incentivize support to generate a positive outlook.
3. **Knowledge**: Conduct detailed training sessions that cover new skills and processes. Ensure that all materials and resources are provided to understand the changes thoroughly.
4. **Ability**: Support the practical application of new skills through coaching and real-time feedback. Adjust work environments to facilitate change and provide the necessary tools.
5. **Reinforcement**: Use mechanisms like follow-ups, recognition programs, and success stories to reinforce and institutionalize the change. Regularly solicit feedback to address any ongoing issues.

**Usage Considerations:**
- Continuous communication is vital throughout all stages of the ADKAR model to maintain momentum and ensure clarity.
- Tailoring the approach to fit the specific culture and needs of the organization increases the likelihood of successful change implementation.
